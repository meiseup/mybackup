GStreamer

From http://www.gstreamer.net/:

    GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing.

Simply, GStreamer is a backend or framework utilized by many media players.

GStreamer uses a plugin architecture which makes the most of GStreamer's functionality implemented as shared libraries. Since version 0.10 the plugins come grouped into three sets (named after the film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly).wikipedia:GStreamer

 gstreamer0.10-base-plugins gstreamer0.10-good-plugins gstreamer0.10-bad-plugins gstreamer0.10-ugly-plugins gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg

For the most complete solution:

# pacman -S gstreamer0.10-plugins
